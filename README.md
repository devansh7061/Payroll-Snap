## PaySnap
PaySnap aims to create a payroll management service for an organization by batching transactions to multiple addressses, and helps maintain an address book of your organization, with designated transaction amount to the addresses.

## Aim of the project
This project aims to build an enterprise finance management system on MetaMask starting with a payroll management system, and an address book. We aim to other add-ons on this snap which include features like split expense (splitting an expense amongst many people), multiple organization management, and others.
